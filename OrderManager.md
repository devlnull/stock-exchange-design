# Order Manager
The order manager receives orders on one end and receives executions on the other. It mannages the orders states. 
The order manager receives inbound orders from the client gateway and performs the following:
-   It sends the order for risk checks. Our requirements for risk checking are simple. For example, we verify that a user's trade volume is below $1M a day.
-   It checks the order against the userâ€™s wallet and verifies that there are sufficient funds to cover the trade.
-   It sends the order to the sequencer where the order is stamped with a sequence ID. The sequenced order is then processed by the matching engine. There are many attributes in a new order, but there is no need to send all the attributes to the matching engine. To reduce the size of the message in data transmission, the order manager only sends the necessary attributes.

On the other end, the order manager receives executions from the matching engine via the sequencer. The order manager returns the executions for the filled orders to the brokers via the client gateway.

The order manager should be fast, efficient, and accurate. It maintains the current states for the orders. In fact, the challenge of managing the various state transitions is the major source of complexity for the order manager. There can be tens of thousands of cases involved in a real exchange system.
